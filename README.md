# General Business and Accounting

This will be an unusual introduction to business and accounting. One targeted at future developers. We will start with you, because business starts with you. Let's understand many concepts of the business world by understanding how to use your computing environment in the most optimal way for you. This means understanding operating systems, shells, and customization options. We will be reflecting on efficiency, productivity and automation. Working our way up to the market, where you need to position yourself as a developer and compete with others. Building your personal profiles and understanding collaborative systems like Git and Github is key. Building and maintaining your digital identity by sharing learning and projects will help foster your personal development. Reflecting on this journey means looking at accounting and budgeting your personal business/brand. Join us for the most unusual journey into the business world. It all starts with you.

## Structure

- Lecture: CS concepts (60min):
- Hands-on: C Programming Practice (60min) and OS customization (60 min)

## Exam and Class Project

- Reach out:  Create blog on Github Pages.
- Hands-on: Write at least 4 blog posts (1000 words each) on a self-chosen operating systems automation project
- Iterate: Make sure there is at least one week between each post, try and engage as many classmates as possible to use and feedback on your automation and blog content.
- Reflect:  Feedback on both Automation Projects should be as specific as possible and in the form of Pull Requests.
